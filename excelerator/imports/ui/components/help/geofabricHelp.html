    <p>
        In the geofabric data there is a specific mapping of river regions to contracted catchments. This mapping represents the 
        hydrological contributions of a catchment to its parent river region outflow, a grouping of sorts. However, due to the geophysical properties of some
        catchments (those internally draining), not all catchments contribute to the outflow of any river region. Because we assumed (incorrectly)
        the mapping table was a purely spatial representation, it has lead to areas of a river region that are not spatially covered by contracted catchments. (See the image below)

        <strong>We are currently in the process of defining a purely spatial based mapping of contracted catchments to river regions.</strong>

    <h5>Effect on outputs</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>IderDown</strong> has incomplete data when asking for contracted catchment ids filtered by river region or drainage division, you will have missing contracted catchments ids due to missing sfWithin statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Excelerator</strong> has no side effects yet as the tool doesn't allow the use of river regions.
